# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible
receiving such patches depend on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| CVSS v3.0 | Supported Version                        |
| 1.0 | Most recent release                       |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities to
**[info.decawaretech@gmail.com](mailto:info.decawaretech@gmail.com)**. You will receive a response from
us within 24 hours. If the issue is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon
as possible depending on complexity but historically within a few days.
